# hangManTwo

Object based word guess game written in vanilla javascript

1. Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed.

2. Save your whole game and its properties in an object.

3.  Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.

4. Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
   * Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
